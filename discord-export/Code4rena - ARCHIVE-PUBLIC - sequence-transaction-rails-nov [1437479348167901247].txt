👋 Hello and welcome to the **$18,500 in USDC Sequence: Transaction Rails** audit channel!

📆 Audit opens Tuesday, 11 November 2025 (20:00 UTC) and runs through Monday, 17 November 2025 (20:00 UTC) (6 days).

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this audit, consider enabling notifications for this channel. 🐺 ⏰

**❗A coded, runnable PoC is required for all High/Medium submissions to this audit.**
- The audit repo includes a basic PoC template to run the test suite.
- PoCs **must** use the test suite provided in the audit repo.
- Your submission will be marked as `Insufficient` if the POC is not runnable and working with the provided test suite.
- Exception: PoC is optional (though recommended) for wardens with signal ≥ 0.68

The audit repo will include a list of findings identified by [V12](https://v12.zellic.io/), [Zellic's](https://zellic.io/) in-house AI auditing tool.
[All issues found by V12](https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-11-sequence?tab=readme-ov-file#v12-findings) will be judged as out of scope and ineligible for awards.

🔎 **Got audit-related questions? Here's your roadmap** 

Find the information you need efficiently:

1. Step 1: **Review project documentation** in the audit repo. [Join the audit](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-11-sequence-trails) for access.
2. Step 2: Use **🤖 Docs Wolf,** C4's documentation bot assistant. Open a private thread, tag `@Docs Wolf`, and ask your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.
3. Step 3: If you still need clarification after reviewing the docs, feel free to **ask the Sequence team** directly. From [the audit page](https://code4rena.com/audits/2025-11-sequence-trails), join the audit and select the `Q & A` tab.

To ensure sponsors can focus their time on questions that truly need their expertise, please: 

- Reference what you've already checked in the docs
- Be specific about what you need clarified
- Use thread replies to keep discussions organized

Good hunting!

GM wardens - we've received some reports that Docs Wolf is not responding. Our dev team will look into it when they're online, and we'll post an update here when the issue is resolved.

@🐺Wardens - Docs Wolf should now be up and running! Please let us know in #❓・questions if you encounter any issues.
